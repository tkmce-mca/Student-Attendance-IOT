**LEVEL OF PROJECT**

We are using CNN algorithm and some of LBPH algorithm
We are done with face detection from an image shown.

Currently we are working to extract images from live video stream and load it into the database.
After that in future we will be creating a simple web application for including new admissions and a simple android application for invoking an outside webcam

**ROLE**

FRONT END: Anaconda and open cv
BACK END: MONGODB

 **OPEN ISSUES**

We are facing a problem in importing the libraries for face recognition(open cv,matlib etc) and extracting images from a live video stream.
The connection with the webcam is perfect but not able to scan images.
